How to Contribute
=================

nerveCenter is a pretty lightweight library, but there might still be bugs or potentially useful features we hadn't yet 
thought of. The guidelines are pretty light if you'd like to dive in.

- Please try to maintain coding standards. It's based on WordPress VIP's styles with [Yoda conditions][yoda].
- Add unit tests as you add features. We're using Jasmine with Karma.

Note that nerveCenter uses the BSD 3-Clause license, so any changes can be freely used with commercial products as well.
Note that contributions will be subject to that too.
