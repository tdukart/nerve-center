NerveCenter is a lightweight JavaScript library to aid the development of simple games (or probably other apps!). It
allows your app to broadcast messages on specific channels and create listeners for them.

The impetus of this library is to simplify the creation of a master controller that a game could extend to handle a
multitude of broadcasts simply and safely. Although similar in spirit to jQuery's event system (although, of course,
not bound to the DOM), this is designed as a prototype to be extended into a full-featured controller.

This library is not affiliated with any of the author's current or past employers.
