NerveCenter
===========

NerveCenter is a lightweight JavaScript component to aid the development of
simple games (or probably other apps!). It allows your app to listen for
arbitrary message events and publish them.

Roadmap
-------
- Milestone1: Local events with publish and subscribe methods
- Milestone2: JSON-based server communication
- Milestone3: Permissioning (only allow player1 client to publish player1
  events)
